Hey, I'm Rajika Chathuranga, a Full-Stack Developer, currently pursuing Master's Degree in Advanced Software Engineering at the University of Westminster. Started off at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka for my Bachelor's â€“ that's where the coding journey kicked in.

Right now, I'm doing the software hustle at IXD Labs, a cool startup in Sri Lanka. My gig? Software Engineer. I'm all about whipping up web apps that aren't just functional but actually make sense to real people. It's the sweet spot where tech meets user-friendly vibes, and I'm here for it, one line of code at a time.
